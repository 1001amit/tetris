# Tetris Game

This is a simple Tetris game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game includes a scoring system and a level system that increases the difficulty as you progress.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Scoring system based on the number of lines cleared
- Level system that increases the game's speed as more lines are cleared
- Display of current score, level, and lines cleared

## Installation

To run the game, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed.
1. **Clone the repository or download the files.**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1001amit/tetris.git
    ```



2. **Pygame Installation**:
   - Install Pygame using pip:

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**:
   - Execute the game script:
